A simple web browser for Unix system packages 

demo web site at http://gentle-waterfall-18.heroku.com/

WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Usage instructions:

  git clone git://github.com/ohadlevy/dish.git
  cd dish
  bundle install

  copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml (and modify if you don't want to use sqlite)
  rake db:migrate

start the background service (as we process the package information in the background not to keep the web browser busy)
rake jobs:work (leave it running)

Start your webserver (./script/server) - You may start it while the import is running.

In order to send the package information to dish you would need to run an import script, either on each machine, or from one machine which ssh to others
an example sciprt can be found at extras/push_info.rb script

You would need to modify the script in order to get the host list - get it somehow (I use it from foreman)

Note that the first few imports would be slow, as we need to initialize the entire packages/versions information, future imports should be fairly fast.
